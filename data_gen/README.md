project-sbac
========

This is the SBAC-specific stuff for data generation.

##Installation

This is a Python 3 project and as such you will need Python 3 installed to use and/or develop the project. One note to
Mac OS X users: If you installed your Python 3 prior to upgrading to Mavericks, you will need to uninstall and
re-install Python 3.

###pip

The easiest way to get `pip` is to download it from [here](https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py)
and then run:

    python get-pip.py

Just make sure the `python` binary is a version 3 binary.

###virtualenv

Optional, but it is recommended that you use a virtual environment for development of this project. This can be
installed with pip.

    pip install virtualenv

Again, if you have multiple `pip`s, make sure this is a Python 3 version.

###Create Virtual Environment

Optional, but recommended. To set up a virtual environment, execute the following command:

    virtualenv data-gen-env

Where `data-gen-env` is the name of the directory where you want your environment files placed. You can activate the
virtual environment with this command:

    source data-gen-env/bin/activate

Note that `data-gen-env` is the same name that was used with the creation of the environment. If you change the name of
the environment in the first command, change it in this command too.

###Install Run Dependencies

Once you have your environment activated (or you've decided not to use an environment), go into your repository and run
this command to finish setup:

    python setup.py develop

Note the use of `develop` in the call to `setup.py`. This will create a sym-link from the site-packages directory to the
working directory of your code. If instead you use `install`, it will copy the code and changes you make to the code
will probably not be picked up.

###Install Development Dependencies

You will need `nose` to run the test suites. Along with those, we are using
[`coverage`](http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/) for a unit testing code coverage report and
[`pep8`](http://pep8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) as a style checker. If you have a virtual environment, run this within
it:

    pip install nose coverage pep8

##Usage

There are two scripts you can choose the start up to generate data. First is `generate_data.py`, which is the
single-process version. `mp_generate_data.py` is a multi-processed version that generates the same data, but when on the
right hardware it will do it faster.

For either script, the following arguments apply:

* `--team TEAM_NAME`: Specify the team name to generate SBAC data for (expects `sonics` or `arkanoids`)
* `--state_name STATE_NAME`: Specify the name of the state that gets generated (defaults to `North Carolina`)
* `--state_code STATE_CODE`: Specify the code of the state that gets generated (defaults to `NC`)
* `--state_type STATE_TYPE`: Specify the hierarchy type for the state to generate (expects `devel`, `typical_1`, or
`california`)

The multi-processed script also takes a flag `--process_count`, which is the number of processes to have running
simultaneously. Every process will work on one district at a time (e.g. four processes will be working on four
districts simultaneously) so start as many processes as the hardware can handle. The default is 2.

##Unit Tests

Within the project is a suite of unit tests that cover a large percentage of the codebase. We are using `nose` for the
unit tests. To run the unit tests, start from the root of the project and call:

    nosetests unit_tests/*

As you develop new functionality, make sure to write accompanying unit tests so as maintain good code coverage and the
confidence that comes with it.

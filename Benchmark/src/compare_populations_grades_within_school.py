Grades withing a school query & benchmarks

Public interface:
school_statistics(state_id, engine, schema_name)
grades_in_a_school(state_id, asmt_type, asmt_subject, engine, schema_name)

Descriptions:
'school_statistics()' prints statistics for how long it takes for the query to return
for each of the different types of queries:
Summative-ELA, Summative-Math, Interim-ELA, Interim-Math

'grades_in_a_school()': returns the result of running the query on the
given parameters

Util
====

This place is for resuable code. We may need to think what belongs to lib and util.
both are resuable for other part of the projects or other projects.

I (Eugene Jen) think lib is for code that can be called by others. Utils is for tools
programs that can be use by others. (But it may be a little blurry because in Python,
a module can be util or lib, it depends on context of its usage)

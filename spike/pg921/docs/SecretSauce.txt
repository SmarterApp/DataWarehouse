James,
 
Once again, apologies for my tardiness.
 
The secret sauce I’m about to give you is for discovering queries issued by Rasberi, which encompasses DYD (download-your-data feature) queries as well as Comparing Populations pilot functionality.  Both of those areas include interactions with parameter services and comparing populations of course culminates in report running, while DYD runs a humongous query, similar to a report, but returning raw data.  Here’s some background info on Rasberi:

http://wiki.wgenhq.net/wiki/index.php/Rasberi/Machines_By_Environment
http://wiki.wgenhq.net/wiki/index.php/Rasberi/Test_Users_By_Environment
 
On to the secret sauce.  When you go to splunk, run something like this:
 
source="/opt/wgen/log/dxm/stat.log" (NOT "select 1 as value") dxm.database.dw.exec_query_for_iter
 
This will give you queries that DXM (data layer behind Rasberi) runs.  You will get back snippets of actual Python, along with parameters.  You can deduce from those snippets parameters that were passed on to the SQL templates.  You can also go into the DXM shell and execute said Python in it to retrieve the actual SQL (evaluate the templates).  Let me know if you have questions.  A good starting point for simpler queries, as I mentioned is manipulation of parameters.
 
A note about getting into Rasberi front end.  First, refer to the link above about machines and environments.  You will currently only see full comparing populations pilot on FQA.  So go to mclasshome on FQA.  Enter Reporting section, go to “Build a report” and finally, click on “Comparing Populations (new)” button.

Ken,
 
Tomorrow’s meetings are indeed in jeopardy, not only due to office potentially not being open, but also since some folks probably will be unable to travel for a while (NJ in particular).  We’d be happy to reschedule, if you find a critical number of people from your side will not be able to join us.
 
As to the queries, I’d be interested to know if Jamie was able to make use of the technique I sent him to extract both simple and complex queries using the front end.  Specifically, parameter manipulation in Rasberi maps very well to simple queries against dimensions, particularly on the enrollment fact.
 
Taking a step back though, consider the following query:
 
select assmt_code, assmt_name, count(0)
from dw.dim_assmt_outcome_type
group by assmt_code, assmt_name
 
This is something that should most certainly work and is virtually identical to a real-world assessment parameter query in Rasberi.  If COUNT above presents a challenge, we can see if taking it out yields something functional.  On CQA, I get the following, which should be similar to FQA, but I can’t connect to it at this time:
 
assmt_code assmt_name count

In terms of reaching out to other folks within RPT (besides Santosh, with whom you guys worked a bit already and who is unfortunately cut off at this time like many others), I would ask you guys to wait until next week to talk to our QA due to a number of critical things we’re investigating and getting out the door at the moment.  Also, please reach out to Andy Park with questions about capacity within our group.  I’m looping him in.
 
I hope you and your colleagues are all safe and sound at this time.

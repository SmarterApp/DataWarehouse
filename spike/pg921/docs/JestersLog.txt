The RPT FQA DB has been ported to MonetDB and Postgrtes 9.2.1

Working out a Query Test Harness to Validate the Thesis that we can actually pull this off with a non commercial open source database platform.

The Test MonetDB spike has transformed into build a Spike Process where by we can validate persistence engines against fundamental Smarter/EdWare Reporting Requirements.

The core technology risk right now as I see it is that relative to the back end requirements and actual data, we are flying blind. We need a sample set of payload files along with a spec or a logical data model from AIR asap so that we know what we are working with and begin the required analysis to properly automate this process.

We know the data and formatting will change over time, we are prepared for this, but if AIR doesn't give us something to begin building a Continuous Integration Process around the AIR/Smarter EdWare Assessment ETL Payload, like NOW, cramming it all together at the last minute under duress is going to be a very dodgy proposition.

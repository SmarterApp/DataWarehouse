'''
First Worker in the UDL Pipeline.
The file will initially arrive at landing_zone/arrivals
This worker first creates a GUID_BATCH for the file.
Then, it will create landing_zone/work/GUID_BATCH/arrived.
Then, it moves the file from landing_zone/arrivals to landing_zone/work/GUID_BATCH/arrived/

The output of this worker will serve as the input to the subsequent worker [file_expander].

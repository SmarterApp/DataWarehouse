Ordering students by Overall scores may reveal groups of students, for example those concentrated around cut-scores or those in need of significant extra support.</li></ul><br><h4>Features:</h4><ul><li>Select Math & ELA or subject-detail</li><li>Select specific students to focus your review</li><li>Sort students by any column:</li><ul><li>Name</li><li>Overall Score</li><li>Sub-scores in subject-detail view</li></ul><li>Filter students by attributes:</li><ul><li>Gender, Race, and Ethnicity</li><li>Limited English Proficient (LEP)</li><li>Disadvantaged status</li><li>Disability (504/IEP)</li></ul></ul><br><h4>More information:</h4><p>A list of students will most often be used to see a section or class at-a-glance for a given assessment. Single-point Overall scale-scores and Error Bands are provided to illustrate a spatial representation of student performance, and the list shows how those Error Bands overlap. Claim scores are provided in numerical form, but are best understood relative to the overall score and compared to each other as relative strengths and weaknesses. The combination may lead to insights that help characterize the results of an assessment for a group of students.</p><br/>",

The error band indicates the range of scores that a student would be very likely to achieve if they were to take the test multiple times. It is similar to the “margin of error” that newspapers report for public opinion surveys."

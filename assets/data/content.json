The College Content-Readiness Policy operates within the context of existing institutional admission policies; open-admission institutions will serve many students who do not meet the benchmark, and highly selective institutions may not admit students who score at Level 3 or 4. In addition, student course-taking decisions in HS will continue to be influenced by admission requirements of colleges and universities. For example, students at Level 4 who plan to seek admission to selective institutions will make course choices for Grade 12 that comply with the requirements of those institutions. By identifying students who are either on track or ready for credit-bearing courses, schools may be better able to advise students on college options and Grade 12 courses. Finally, institutions may choose to include SBAC scores in admission decisions.",

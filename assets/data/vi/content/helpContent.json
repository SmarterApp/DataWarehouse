                        "question": "Who can access the Smarter Balanced Reports?",
                        "answer": "The password-protected reporting system provides information to state and district leaders, principals, teachers, parents, guardians and students.<br><br>Access to information will vary based on users’ educational roles and associated system permissions.<br><br>The Consortium will make Consortium-level results available to the general public via a different system."},

                        "question": "What types of reports are available?",
                        "answer": "There are three types of reports:<ul><li>Aggregate, or rolled up, reports present a view of student performance on the most recent summative assessment for the state, district, school or grade. These reports show comparisons between districts in a state, schools in a district, or grades in a school. These reports are available to all authorized educators to see their state, district and school information.</li><li>The List of Students report displays overall scores and claim-level information for a group of students in a school. This report is only available to educators with access to personally identifiable information for the group of students in the report.  This report provides information for summative and interim assessments.</li><li>The Individual Student Report presents overall scores and claim-level information for an individual student. Educators with access to personally identifiable information for a student are able to view this report and share it with parents and students via print out or email.  This report provides information for summative and interim assessments.</li></ul>"},
                       {"id": 3,
                        "question": "How does Smarter Balanced protect students’ privacy?",
                        "answer": "Smarter Balanced has taken a number of steps to ensure that all student data is stored securely and protected.<ul><li>Data Separation – all data sent from a state to the Smarter Balanced Data Warehouse will be stored in its own set of data stores to ensure that users from one state are not permitted to view another state’s data.</li><li>Single Sign On (SSO) – Users will log into the reporting system through the Smarter Balanced SSO, which will control user access centrally and provide users with access as directed by their states .</li><li>User access control - States control the level of access that they grant their users and the Data Warehouse enforces those rules. This allows each state to set its own policies around the protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and to protect against unauthorized access to student data.<br><br>States will define which districts and schools a user is entitled to see as well as whether they can see any student information. If they are entitled to see student information, the user access policies dictate which student data they are allowed to view.<br><br>States control data for students in their state, not the Consortium, and states are the only entity that can grant access to data.  The Consortium is simply the custodian of stored data.</li><li>Encryption – All data stored in the Data Warehouse is encrypted to protect it against external threats.</li></ul>"},
                       {"id": 4,
                        "question": "How is data generated for these reports?",
                        "answer": "Student assessment scores will be calculated using scoring protocols commonly used by all states and will include computer-scored items and hand-scored items. Student scores will be passed to the Smarter Balanced data warehouse on a schedule defined by each state. Once the scored data is passed over, the reports will be available."}]},

                        "answer": "States and districts provision user accounts for educators and administrators. All authorized users can login and review aggregate data across their registering state, at the district, school and grade level.  Only users with specific permissions, as managed by the states and districts, can access Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for students."},
                        {"id": 2,
                        "question": "How can I get access to the Reporting system to see my students’ scores?",
                        "answer": "States and districts provide educators with user logins and passwords for the Smarter Balanced Assessment System. Educators can login to the reporting system through the Smarter Balanced portal or through the reporting system landing page."},
                        {"id": 3,
                        "question": "Where can I find resources to help me understand how to use the reporting system?",
                        "answer": "The Smarter Balanced Digital Library houses Score Reporting Modules to help users understand how to use the Smarter Balanced Reporting System. Modules provide an overview of navigation features that enable users to access data, including Summative and Interim Comprehensive Assessment data. Instructional videos, interactive learning activities, and relevant real-life scenarios explain how to identify the purpose of, locate, and use the Smarter Balanced Reporting System’s navigation features.<br><br>Links to these modules may be found in the Resources tab of the Help popup."},
                        {"id": 4,
                        "question": "What will the reports tell me about my school’s or district’s performance?",
                        "answer": "The reporting system presents aggregate, or rolled up, reports that display a view of student performance on the most recent summative assessment for the state, district, or school. The reports display multi-colored bars that represent the different achievement levels. The percentages of students and total number of students within each state, district or school performing at each level appear as numbers in the bars."},

                        "question": "What comparisons will the reporting system support?",
                        "answer": "The aggregate reports provide educators with a way to compare district aggregates to each other or to the state aggregate or to compare school aggregates to each other or to the district."},

                        "question": "How do I navigate between academic years?",
                        "answer": "There is an Academic Year Selector available on the upper right-hand corner, under the report title (e.g., “Districts in Example State”). The academic years available for selection are derived from the assessment results that are loaded into the Data Warehouse."},
                        {"id": 7,
                        "question": "How do I navigate between test types?",
                        "answer": "Aggregate reports only include Summative assessment data.  At the grade-level and below, reports that display individual student data also have an Assessment Selector. This feature provides the ability to select between Summative and Interim assessment results for the chosen report."},
                        {"id": 8,
                        "question": "After completing testing, when will reports be available?",
                        "answer": "The time between when a given student completes an assessment and when that student’s assessment record is included in reports will depend on a number of factors, chiefly the time it takes to score all the items on the tests.<br><br>The Data Warehouse accepts individual scored records from the Test Administration System, and processes uploaded records once a day.  Once loaded, the data is available for reporting immediately.<br><br>Estimated performance profiles for each step in the process are documented on <a href='http://www.smarterapp.org' target='_blank'>http://www.SmarterApp.org</a>."}]},

The scores are presented as an overall score in each subject on a scale; an achievement level of 1 to 4; and sub-scores within each subject. The report will also show your child’s scores on any interim block assessments given to them over the course of the year.<br/><br/>Explanatory text on the report will describe what the achievement levels mean and how to interpret the report."},

				<h4>Purpose:</h4>
				<p>This report is intended to provide top-level insight into the results of a single student’s summative assessment.  There is more detailed information available on the various parts that come together to make this summary possible.</p>
				
				<h4>Uses:</h4>
				<p>Use this report to understand where this student is, in terms of their assessed grade, on the path towards career and college content-readiness.  If the descriptions provided within do not match your understanding of where the student should be, use the more detailed information to ascertain where the discrepancy may be.
				Use this report to support the Teacher-Student-Parent partnership, whether it provides context for a parent-teacher conference or helps to identify areas to concentrate on in the coming year(s).</p>
				
				<h4>Qualifications:</h4>
				<p>There may be ways in which the contents of this report might be misconstrued.  The following list contains examples of conclusions that are not supported by this report:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>No score is prescriptive of the abilities of the student, it is simply what they were able to demonstrate during a given assessment administration.  There are always resources available to support a student’s progress.</li>
					<li>This is a criterion-reference test, which provides a characterization of the student’s mastery of a domain of subject matter.  This result in no way indicates whether the test-taker did “better” or “worse” than other people who took the test. Further, the Computer-Adaptive nature of the test makes it very unlikely that two students will ever take exactly the same test.</li>
				</ul>

Smarter Balanced Project
========================

Here is to store Smarter Balanced Project code. 

I (Eugene Jen) think this one is where web front end and application should be stored. Since we want to build a platform
that can be reused by other project. So it seems like client specific product is the web.

But we may need to move platform related code to other part in repository if we want them to be reused.
/lib is for that. But I need to think how do we deal with Framework or other resuable code in system. 

Let's deal the problem when we meet it.
